# All solutions and Problems ⚖️

for this app we have some solutions like :

1. ✅ checking by send mail 📧: it is good but we have a limitation for sending E-mail's📧, useing more than one E-mail's 📧 is other one , if we have a milion E-mail's
       we need a proxy list and ip's .
2. ✅ checking by validate_email library : it take a while and we have a time ⌛ problem in it not good one.
3. ✅ checking by validate_email library with threading : perhaps it is good one if we use in right way 🛣️.


# How to Application 🈸

we have tree label 🏷️ first one is showing the number of E-mail's 📧 and other's for showing vaild and invalid E-mail's 📧 all vaild E-mail are in a file name GOOOD.txt in 
app 🈸 directory , we most select a txt file to Enable the start button , and we have timer in the end of sceen📺.
